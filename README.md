# Airbnb Toronto Dashboard Project

This project explores Airbnb listings in Toronto using Tableau. The goal is to uncover patterns related to pricing, reviews, and geographic location using interactive dashboards.

1. **Price Influencers** – Scatter plots showing how availability, minimum nights, and review scores affect pricing.
2. **Neighborhood Ratings** – Bar charts of top and bottom-rated areas, filtered by listing popularity.
3. **Review Map** – A map showing spatial distribution of top-rated and poorly rated listings, filtered by price.
